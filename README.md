# soothe

Soothe is an app that helps to focus/de-stress you, while you've been working for a long time. 
It is built in React with some neat CSS properties. 
I hope you think about using my app or building one for yourself, as this really has helped my productivity!

Check out my custom homepage to see a live demo of Soothe <a href="https://pacific-stream-57279.herokuapp.com/">here.</a>

Thanks for stopping by and happy coding!
